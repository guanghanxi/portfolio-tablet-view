      <h2>Origin of Computer</h2>
      <p>Before the electrical age, human beings have invented computers based on mechanical devices. The earliest mechanical computer dates back to BC. However, most of early mechanical computer can only be used for specific calculation purposes, such as astronomical prediction. </p>

      <h2>Mechanical Computor</h2>
      <p>Over time, mechanical computers which could perform vatious basic operations appeared. In fact, those mechanical computers have been still widely used after the invention of electronic computer, which was too expensive to be popular at first. </p>

      <h2>Electromechanical Computer</h2>
      <p> In fact, electromechanical computer should be considered as mechanical compuer becuase it's just use the electric to drive machines. However, it's also considered as the beginning of digital computer.</p>

      <h2>Vaccum Tube Computer</h2>
      <p>In 1946, the first modern computer, ENIAC(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was invented in the US. Its core is composed of 18,000 vaccum tubes. The vaccum tubes computer is also known as the first generation of mordern computer.</p>

    <div class="transistor text-block">
      <h2>Transistor Computer</h2>
      <p>In 1948, the Bell Labs invented the work transistor. Since transistor is far more efficient than vaccum tube, it led to the revolution in the computer field.  In 1953, the first transistor computer was created in University of Manchester. The transistor computer is the second generation of computer.</p>

      <h2>Integrated Circuit</h2>
      <p>To make the computer more efficient, engineers integrated thousands of transistors on one silicon chip. Then the IC computer become the third and the fourth generation of computer, and also the most widely used computer nowadays. </p>

      <h2>Supercomputer</h2>
      <p>Supercomputers are computers with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer. Most of supercomputers are used for complex calculation in scientific research. For example, climate scientists can use supercomputers to make weather forecasts.</p>

      <h2>Future Computer</h2>
      <p>There are various predictions for the future computer. Some of those future computers has prototypes, such as DNA computer and quantum computer. Most of mordern computers are transistor computers. However, in the future, different types of computers may exist at the same time, and work in different fields.</p>
