      <h1>Mechanical Computer</h1>
      <p>Present computers are based on electronics technology</br> </br> But computers has been invented before the electricity age.</p>

    <div class="intro text-block">
      <p>Mechanical computers are compsed of mechanical devices, such as gears, instead of electronic components. <br>
        In the first half of twentieth century, mechanical computers were widely used. However, with the rapid development of integrated circuits, mechanical have been replaced by electric computer. </p>

      <h2>Antikythera Mechanism</h2>
      <p>It's considered as the oldest computer discovered so far in the world. Experts consider that it was used by ancient Greeks in around 100 BC to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance.</p>

      <h2>Cosmic Engine</h2>
      <p>Chinese Su Song invented a lot of machines to Make astronomical predictions in thirteenth centrury. Those machines are also considered as mechanical computer. </p>

      <h2>Universial Mechanical Computer</h2>
      <p> Both the above two examples are special machenical computers, which can be only used to make astronomical predictions. With development of technology, human beings invented universal mechanical computers, which can perform all kinds of  basic algebraic operations.

      <h2>Pascal's calculator</h2>
      <p>In the mid seventeenth century, Blaise Pascal invented this mechanical calculator. Different from above two computers, this calculter could be used to perform basic algebraic operations, including addation and subtraction.

      <h2>Analytical Engine</h2>
      <p>In 1837, Charles Babbage designed this calculation machine, whose architecture had been very close to the modern computer. 
      </br> It was composed of arithmetic logic unit, control unit, and memory unit. Compared with modern computer, it just lacked complete input unit and output unit. Unfortunately, because of lack of funding, Charles was never able to implement his design.

      <h2>Z1</h2>
      <p>In 1938, Konrad Zuse completed the first freely programmable computer in the world. Though it was not very reliable, Z1 is also the landmark invention in the computer field.</p>

    <div class="emc text-block">
      <h2>Electromechanical Computer</h2>
      <p>Electromechanical Computer are considered as the transition from mechanical computer to electronic computer. However, the core of Electromechanical Computer is still mechanical device, while electricity is mainly used to drive the machine. In that case, Electromechanical Computer is more like a special type of mechanical computer.</p>

      <h2>Torpedo Data Computer(TDC)</h2>
      <p>TDC is a kind of early Electromechanical Computer. During World War II, it was used for torpedo fire-control on American submarines. </p>

    <div class="mmc text-block">
      <h2>Modern Mechanical Computer</h2>
      <p>Mechanical computers are still widely used after the invention of electric computer, because early electric computer are expensive and unreliable. 
      </br> However, since the invention of transistor and integrated circuits, electric computers have become far more efficient and reliable than mechanical computers. Nowadays, mechanical computers have become exhibits in museums or teaching appliance.

      <h2>Curta</h2>
      <p>In 1948, Curt Herzstark invented a kind of hand-held mechanical calculator, Curta Calculator. It had been widely used in cars and aircraft before the 1980s because the early electric computers could not stand violent vibration. </p>
