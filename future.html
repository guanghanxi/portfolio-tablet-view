      <h2>Integrated Circuits</h2>
      <p>Large scale Integrated Circuits(IC) is the base of the modern computer. It means creating millons of transistors on one silicon chip. </p>

      <p>Generally, the more transistors there are per unit area, the better the chip performs. That's why almost all computer and chip companies have been researching how to make transistors smaller. </p>

      <h2>Moore's Law</h2>
      <p>In 1965, Gordon Moore made the famous prediction that the number of transistors in a dense IC double about every 18 months. This prediction is also known as the Moore's Law. </p>

      <h2>Transistor</h2>
      <p> Nowadays, with the most advanced techniqu, the IBM has produced IC with 2nm size transistors. It seems that the scale of transistors has been decreasing. However, in theory, since the constraints of thermodynamic and quantum, the smallest scale of traditional transistor is about 1 nm.</p>

    <div class="new text-block">
      <h2>New Technology</h2>
      <p>The Moore's Law has been close to the physical limit. To improve computers performance, engineers need to design a new generation of computers.</p>

      <h2>Biological Computer</h2>
      <p>Since the development of molecular biology, scientists put forward the idea of biological computer. Biological computer use biologically derived materials, such as DNA and RNA, to perform computational functions. </p>

      <h2>Optical Computer</h2>
      <p>Optical Computers replace electrons with photons, wires with optical fibers. In fact, even in some present computers, optical components are playing important roles. In that case, integrated optical path has great potential to replace integrated circuits in the future.</p>

      <h2>Quantum Computer</h2>
      <p>Traditional transistor has only two states, while one quantum have various states. Therefore, hundreds of quantums can be even more efficient that millions of transistors.</p>
