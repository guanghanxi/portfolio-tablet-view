      <h2>Integrated Circuits</h2>
      <p>Large scale Integrated Circuits(IC) is the base of the modern computer. It means creating millons of transistors on one silicon chip. </p>

      <p>Generally, the more transistors there are per unit area, the better the chip performs. That's why almost all computer and chip companies have been researching how to make transistors smaller. </p>

      <h2>Moore's Law</h2>
      <p>In 1965, Gordon Moore made the famous prediction that the number of transistors in a dense IC double about every 18 months. This prediction is also known as the Moore's Law. 
      </br> The Moore's Law has successfully predicted the IC development so far. Chip manufacturers consider that the Moore's Law will continue to predict the IC development in the future. However, since the physical limitations, some experts argue that the Moore's Law has died.

      <h2>Transistor</h2>
      <p> The modern transistor, MOS transistor, was invented in 1950s. In 1955 April, IBM announced the first commercial fully transistorized calculator, the IBM 608. At that time, size of transistors are hundreds of microns.
      </br> So far, the size of transistors has shrunk by nearly a million times. Nowadays, transistors in most computers are around 10-20 nanometers in scale. Meanwhile, the IBM has produced IC with 2 nanometers size transistors.  
      </br>It seems that the scale of transistors has been decreasing. However, in theory, since the constraints of thermodynamic and quantum, the smallest scale of traditional transistor is about 1 nm.</p>

      <h2>New Technology</h2>
      <p>The Moore's Law has been close to the physical limit. To improve computers performance, engineers need to design a new generation of computers.</p>

      <h2>Biological Computer</h2>
      <p>Since the development of molecular biology, scientists put forward the idea of biological computer. Biological computer use biologically derived materials, such as DNA and RNA, to perform computational functions. </p>

      <h2>Neuron Computer</h2>
      <p> Though modern computer technology has been considerably advanced, the most complex computer is not created by humans. Itâ€™s been less than a hundred years since the invention of computers, but the biological brain has evolved for hundreds of millions of years. Nowadays, The computing power of the most advanced computers can only be compared with the brains of lower animals. 
        </br> In that case, some scientists put forward the idea of designing computer through imitating a biological brain. Those computers are also known as neutron computers.

      <h2>Optical Computer</h2>
      <p>Optical Computers replace electrons with photons, wires with optical fibers. In fact, even in some present computers, optical components are playing important roles. In that case, integrated optical path has great potential to replace integrated circuits in the future.</p>
